My name is Piotr and I'm a software developer from southern Poland.
I mostly work with Python to create web applications, process data and automate everyday tasks, 
but I don't avoid some JavaScript now and then.
I'm currently working for <a href="https://blue-focus.com/en/">Blue Focus</a> 
and I own <a href="http://www.kofilabs.com/">KofiLabs</a>.

My perfect moment? To sit with my wife, watching sunset over Tatra mountains with cup of good Ethiopian V-60 coffee.
