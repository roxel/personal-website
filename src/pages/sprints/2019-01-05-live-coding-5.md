  Prepare code and practise for live coding presentation about automating everyday tasks with Python.

This sprint turned out to be quite a challenge. Presentation consisting mainly of showing and explaining code requires not only knowledge itself, 
but also a lot of preparations. Even in a situation when know exactly what your doing and you can ask any question, 
the trick is it show your code in a way that's clear, step by step. Anything that is introduced to a script must be described - can't just appear out of nowhere.
I'm glad that I worked on this project. I hope ideas and knowledge I've shown during event was worth the time of my participants
and I believe my future presentation will be more valuable and entertaining.
