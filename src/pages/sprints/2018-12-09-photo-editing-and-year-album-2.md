  Learn basics of Adobe Lightroom. Practice while creating a year album.

I managed to check over a thousand photos just to select 70 to be edited and printed. 
Prints look satisfying, given that images this year were not so great. 
Camera was badly configured on a few trips. Despite that, there were some nice shots
and Lightroom turned out to be an extremely useful piece of software.
