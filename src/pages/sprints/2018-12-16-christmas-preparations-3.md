  Christmas preparations. Researching and implementing GTD method.
---

During the sprint I was focused on finishing few tasks that awaited my attention. 
General idea was to be able to just celebrate without worrying about things needed to be done very soon.

This was a great moment to learn more about Getting Things Done method 
from book by its [author, David Allen](https://gettingthingsdone.com/).
Inspired by some of Allen's ideas and observations I adjusted my personal productivity methods 
(I'm a Trello geek). I'm also trying to implement GTD method for work related responsibilities.
