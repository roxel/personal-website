  Investigate GraphQL academic research opportunities.
---

I spent last days mostly on trying to find any scientific papers related to GraphQL to spot any subareas where some knowledge is missing, questions are left to be answered. 
It turns there aren't as many research documents as I have expected. 
While the topic is extremely popular from engineering point of view - a lot of programmers share their opinions, describe problems and work on tools, science is very far from it. 

One of the few documents about the topic is [Semantics and Complexity of GraphQL](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3186014) by 	Olaf Hartig and Jorge PÃ©rez - it's a conference proceedings paper from 2018 WWW Conference. 
It discusses "grammatical" complexity, trying to formally describe query language syntax.
Other documents I found are mostly university theses, trying to use GraphQL or compare it to other solutions, usually only conceptually. 
It seems that the field is open, anything scientific and innovative (non trivial) will bring value.
