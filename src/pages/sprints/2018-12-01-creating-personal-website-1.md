  Finish a project based on GatsbyJS and Netlify. Start documenting sprints.

I created this website. It will serve as my resum√©, it will link to my profiles and projects.
During this sprint I gained first-person experience of using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), 
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and additionally: [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).
Also this was the first actual sprint I completed.

**Summary**: This sprint was planned to finish in one week. During that time most of expected work was accomplished. 
Only thing left to do is to host it on final URL.

**Ideas**: Configure to enable editing through NetlifyCMS. Add more multimedia content (background image). Add footer.
